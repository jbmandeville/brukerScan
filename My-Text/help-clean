Cleaning:
This page gives the option of cleaning files. In particular, 'fid" files
generally are large and not often used after images have been reconstructed.
Options exist to remove either all 'fid' or DICOM files, or to remove only
those files in the non-selected (i.e., uninteresting) scan directories.
