This page shows the subject name and a list of scans with info about each scan.

By default, scans are only shown in the list if
    1) data was acquired (i.e., a file named 'fid' exists on the scan directory).
    2) ...

You can select a list of "interesting" scans, and this information will be saved.
By default, scans are selected as "interesting" if they have
    1) more than 1 time point,
    2) they have more than 3 slices (not a geometry tripilot).

Highlighted scans can be viewed by fastmap.
